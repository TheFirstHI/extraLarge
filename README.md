# ExtraLarge

ExtraLarge is a community of individuals interested in sharing original ideas that they think can improve the quality of others.

## Stories

* At ExtraLarge users can create custom stories

* Users have the option to submit a photo for stories

* Users can edit the stories which they have published
  * It took me quite some time to be able to display the original image that was on the article and I eventually succeeded in using the image_url attached to each story to display the image

* Users can see a list of all the stories that they have published so far
  * On this page, users have the ability to edit or delete stories through a dropdown menu attached to each story item  
  * Getting the dropdown menus to open individually took me quite some time to implement and I eventually decided to use the event to find the current target and siblings to access the individual dropdown menus instead of using the class name
